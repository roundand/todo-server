# todo-server
docker buildfile and nodejs code for todo app server, to be called by the separate todo-web

Config
------

You need to have an external MongoDB server available. I currently use MonngoLab's free tier (thanks, guys!) - whatever you use, you should add a connection string to app/config.dev.js, as outlined in app/config.js
